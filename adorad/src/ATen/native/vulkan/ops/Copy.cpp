    // This is not great.  We almost never want to flush the GPU pipeline as
    // that has far reaching consequences, especially if PyTorch is not the only
    // process accessing the GPU.  If we have done our job properly, above
    // synchronization mechanisms should be enough to ensure correctness at a more
    // modest cost, as there is no need to flush the entirety of jobs in flight
    // if one is only interested on waiting on computation affecting one single
    // tensor to finish.
    //
    // Having said that, we still do need to release all pool resources at one
    // point per inference run or we will run out of memory otherwise. There is
    // no perfect answer to this problem that checks all boxes, which leaves us
    // with one of several design decisions:
    //
    // 1) Use graph mode to gain an understanding of the computation graph,
    //    itself allowing us to place pool purges intelligently.  Best option
    //    for performance and memory consumption.  Not without its downsides if
    //    flexibility is a top priority.
    // 2) If on eager mode, and hence are seeing operations one at a time, expose
    //    this release of resources to the user as a Python / C++ function.  This
    //    makes for suboptimal user experience but is efficient in terms of
    //    performance.
    // 3) If on eager mode, and interested in keeping this bookkeeping transparent
    //    to the user, release all resources somewhere ... like here.  This is
    //    not ideal since it requires a pipeline flush to make sure these objects
    //    are not already in use by a workload in flight.  Cannot do much better
    //    within the constraints of this approach.  Good for user experience,
    //    suboptimal for performance.
    // 4) If on eager mode, and interested in keeping this bookkeeping transparent
    //    to the user, and performance does not matter, make CPU and GPU run in
    //    lockstep.  Obviously this is just bad.  Mentioned for the sake of
    //    completeness.
