# Note
The images and videos in these folders were obtained from Unsplash.com (images) and Pixabay.com (videos). 

The media files are used for testing purposes only. We test the efficacy of `caer.path.listdir()`, `caer.path.list_images()`, `caer.path.list_videos()` and `caer.path.list_media()`.

Should, for any reason, these media files change their copyright stance (thereby making it illegal to use for this project), kindly [file an issue here](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/issues).
