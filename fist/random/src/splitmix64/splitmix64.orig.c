/* This is a fixed-increment version of Java 8's SplittableRandom generator
   See http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2714064.2660195 and
   http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/SplittableRandom.html

   It is a very fast generator passing BigCrush, and it can be useful if
   for some reason you absolutely want 64 bits of state; otherwise, we
   rather suggest to use a xoroshiro128+ (for moderately parallel
   computations) or xorshift1024* (for massively parallel computations)
   generator. */

uint64_t x; /* The state can be seeded with any value. */

uint64_t next() {
  uint64_t z = (x += 0x9e3779b97f4a7c15);
  z = (z ^ (z >> 30)) * 0xbf58476d1ce4e5b9;
  z = (z ^ (z >> 27)) * 0x94d049bb133111eb;
  return z ^ (z >> 31);
