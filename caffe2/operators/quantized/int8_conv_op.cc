[Only NHWC order is supported now]Note that other parameters, such as the stride and
kernel size, or the pads' sizes in each direction are not necessary for input
because they are provided by the ConvPoolOpBase operator. Various dimension
checks are done implicitly, and the sizes are specified in the Input docs for
this operator. As is expected, the filter is convolved with a subset of the
image and the bias is added; this is done throughout the image data and the
output is computed. As a side note on the implementation layout:
conv_op_impl.h is the templated implementation of the conv_op.h file, which is
why they are separate files.
