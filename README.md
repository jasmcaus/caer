# Caer - Modern Computer Vision on the Fly

Caer is a *lightweight, high-performance* Vision library for high-performance AI research. We wrote this framework to simplify your approach towards Computer Vision by abstracting away unnecessary boilerplate code giving you the **flexibility** to quickly prototype deep learning models and research ideas. The end result is a library quite different in its design, thatâ€™s easy to understand, plays well with others, and is a lot of fun to use.

Our elegant, *type-checked* API and design philosophy makes Caer ideal for students, researchers, hobbyists and even experts in the fields of Deep Learning and Computer Vision.


## Overview

Caer is a Python library that consists of the following components:

| Component | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| [**caer**](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/) | A lightweight GPU-accelerated Computer Vision library for high-performance AI research |
| [**caer.color**](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/tree/master/caer/color) | Colorspace operations |
| [**caer.data**](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/tree/master/caer/data) | Standard high-quality test images and example data |
| [**caer.path**](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/tree/master/caer/path) | OS-specific path manipulations |
| [**caer.preprocessing**](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/tree/master/caer/preprocessing) | Image preprocessing utilities. |
| [**caer.transforms**](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/tree/master/caer/transforms) | Powerful image transformations and augmentations |
| [**caer.video**](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/tree/master/caer/video) | Video processing utilities |

<!-- | [**caer.utils**](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/tree/master/caer/utils) | Generic utilities  | -->
<!-- | [**caer.filters**](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/tree/master/caer/filters) | Sharpening, edge finding, rank filters, thresholding, etc | -->

Usually, Caer is used either as:

- a replacement for OpenCV to use the power of GPUs.
- a Computer Vision research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.


# Installation 
See the Caer **[Installation][install]** guide for detailed installation instructions (including building from source).

Currently, `caer` supports releases of Python 3.6 onwards; Python 2 is not supported (nor recommended). 
To install the current release:

```shell
$ pip install --upgrade caer
```


# Getting Started

## Minimal Example
```python
import caer

# Load a standard 640x427 test image that ships out-of-the-box with caer
sunrise = caer.data.sunrise(rgb=True)

# Resize the image to 400x400 while MAINTAINING aspect ratio
resized = caer.resize(sunrise, target_size=(400,400), preserve_aspect_ratio=True)
```
<img src="examples/thumbs/resize-with-ratio.png" alt="caer.resize()" />

For more examples, see the [Caer demos](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/blob/master/examples/) or [Read the documentation](http://caer.rtfd.io)
