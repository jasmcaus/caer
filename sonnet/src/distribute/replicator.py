  r"""Replicates input, parameters and compute over multiple accelerators.

  ``Replicator`` is a TensorFlow "Distribution Strategy" implementing the
  programming model described in the TF-Replicator paper
  :cite:`buchlovsky2019tf` and TensorFlow RFC
  :cite:`buchlovsky2019distribution`. ``Replicator`` enables data-parallel
  training across multiple accelerators on a single machine, it supports
  eager execution and :tf:`function`.

  To get started create a ``Replicator`` instance:

      >>> replicator = snt.distribute.Replicator()

  Replicator provides a scope inside which any new :tf:`Variable`\ s will be
  replicated across all local devices:

      >>> with replicator.scope():
      ...    mod = snt.Linear(32)

  Additionally replicator provides utility functions to apply a module in
  parallel on multiple devices. First we need to define some computation that
  runs on each GPU. The "replica context" object provides us a way to
  communicate between replicas (e.g. to perform an ``all_reduce``):

      >>> def forward():
      ...   # Compute a random output on each GPU.
      ...   x = tf.random.normal([8, 28 * 28])
      ...   y = mod(x)
      ...   # Synchronize the value of `y` between all GPUs.
      ...   ctx = tf.distribute.get_replica_context()
      ...   y = ctx.all_reduce("mean", y)
      ...   return y

  Finally we use the run API to apply ``forward`` in parallel on all accelerator
  devices:

      >>> per_replica_y = replicator.run(forward)
  """

  :cite:`buchlovsky2019distribution`. ``TpuReplicator`` enables data-parallel
  training across multiple TPUs on one or more machines, it supports

  To get started create a ``TpuReplicator`` instance:

      >>> replicator = snt.distribute.TpuReplicator()

  This provides a scope inside which any new :tf:`Variable`\ s will be
  replicated across all TPU cores:

      ...   ctx = tf.distribute.get_replica_context()
      ...   y = ctx.all_reduce("mean", y)
      ...   return y

  Finally we use the run API to apply ``forward`` in parallel on all TPU
  devices. This must be run as part of a :tf:`function` since ``TpuReplicator``
  uses XLA to compile and replicate our function to run in parallel over all
  TPU cores:

      >>> @tf.function(autograph=False)
      ... def all_forward():
      ...   return replicator.run(forward)

  >>> _ = f(tf.ones([1, 1]))

  On a CPU only machine ``f`` will run ~4x faster (700ms vs. 3s), the benefits
  are more pronounced in a distributed setup since eager variable creation can
  skip a number of checks that are required in graph mode (e.g. checking whether
  the variable has already been created) which end up ping-ponging RPCs.

  Args:
    f: Any function.

  Returns:
    A function running `f` in a context where variables are created eagerly.
