  The difference between VectorQuantizerEMA and VectorQuantizer is that
  this module uses exponential moving averages to update the embedding vectors
  instead of an auxiliary loss. This has the advantage that the embedding
  updates are independent of the choice of optimizer (SGD, RMSProp, Adam, K-Fac,
  ...) used for the encoder, decoder and other parts of the architecture. For
  most experiments the EMA version trains faster than the non-EMA version.
