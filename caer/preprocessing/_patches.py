    Given an n-dimensional array it will return a 2n-dimensional array with
    the first n dimensions indexing patch position and the last n indexing
    the patch content. This operation is immediate (O(1)). A reshape
    performed on the first n dimensions will cause numpy to copy data, leading
    to a list of extracted patches.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
        n-dimensional array of which patches are to be extracted

    patch_shape : int or tuple of length arr.ndim.default=8
        Indicates the shape of the patches to be extracted. If an
        integer is given, the shape will be a hypercube of
        sidelength given by its value.

    extraction_step : int or tuple of length arr.ndim, default=1
        Indicates step size at which extraction shall be performed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray of shape (image_height, image_width) or \

    patch_size : tuple of int (patch_height, patch_width)
        The dimensions of one patch.

    max_patches : int or float, default=None

        of patches.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None

        deterministic.

        The collection of patches extracted from the image, where `n_patches`
