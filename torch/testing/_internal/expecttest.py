# This file implements expect tests (also known as "golden" tests).
# Expect tests are a method of writing tests where instead of
# hard-coding the expected output of a test, you instead run the test to
# get the output, and the test framework automatically populates the
# expected output.  If the output of the test changes, you can rerun the
# test with EXPECTTEST_ACCEPT=1 environment variable to automatically
# update the expected output.
#
# Somewhat unusually, this file implements *inline* expect tests: that
# is to say, the expected output isn't save to an external file, it is
# saved directly in the Python file (and we modify your Python the file
# when updating the expect test.)
#
# The general recipe for how to use this is as follows:
#
#   1. Write your test and use assertExpectedInline() instead of
#      a normal assertEqual.  Leave the expected argument blank
#      with an empty string:
#
#       self.assertExpectedInline(some_func(), "")
#
#   2. Run your test.  It should fail, and you get an error message
#      about accepting the output with EXPECTTEST_ACCEPT=1
#
#   3. Rerun the test with EXPECTTEST_ACCEPT=1.  Now the previously
#      blank string literal will now contain the expected value of
#      the test.
#
#       self.assertExpectedInline(some_func(), "my_value")
#
# Some tips and tricks:
#
#   - Often, you will want to expect test on a multiline string.  This
#     framework understands triple-quoted strings, so you can just
#     write """my_value""" and it will turn into triple-quoted
#     strings.
#
#   - Take some time thinking about how exactly you want to design
#     the output format of the expect test.  It is often profitable
#     to design an output representation specifically for expect tests.
#
