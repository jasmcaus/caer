"""
``torch.autograd`` provides classes and functions implementing automatic
differentiation of arbitrary scalar valued functions. It requires minimal
changes to the existing code - you only need to declare :class:`Tensor` s
for which gradients should be computed with the ``requires_grad=True`` keyword.
As of now, we only support autograd for floating point :class:`Tensor` types (
half, float, double and bfloat16) and complex :class:`Tensor` types (cfloat, cdouble).

    r"""Computes the sum of gradients of given tensors w.r.t. graph leaves.

    The graph is differentiated using the chain rule. If any of ``tensors``
    are non-scalar (i.e. their data has more than one element) and require
    gradient, then the Jacobian-vector product would be computed, in this
    case the function additionally requires specifying ``grad_tensors``.
    It should be a sequence of matching length, that contains the "vector"
    in the Jacobian-vector product, usually the gradient of the differentiated
    function w.r.t. corresponding tensors (``None`` is an acceptable value for
    all tensors that don't need gradient tensors).

    This function accumulates gradients in the leaves - you might need to zero
    ``.grad`` attributes or set them to ``None`` before calling it.
    See :ref:`Default gradient layouts<default-grad-layouts>`
    for details on the memory layout of accumulated gradients.

    .. note::
        Using this method with ``create_graph=True`` will create a reference cycle
        between the parameter and its gradient which can cause a memory leak.
        We recommend using ``autograd.grad`` when creating the graph to avoid this.
        If you have to use this function, make sure to reset the ``.grad`` fields of your
        parameters to ``None`` after use to break the cycle and avoid the leak.

    .. note::

        If you run any forward ops, create ``grad_tensors``, and/or call ``backward``
        in a user-specified CUDA stream context, see
        :ref:`Stream semantics of backward passes<bwd-cuda-stream-semantics>`.

    Arguments:
        tensors (sequence of Tensor): Tensors of which the derivative will be
            computed.
        grad_tensors (sequence of (Tensor or None)): The "vector" in the Jacobian-vector
            product, usually gradients w.r.t. each element of corresponding tensors.
            None values can be specified for scalar Tensors or ones that don't require
            grad. If a None value would be acceptable for all grad_tensors, then this
            argument is optional.
        retain_graph (bool, optional): If ``False``, the graph used to compute the grad
            will be freed. Note that in nearly all cases setting this option to ``True``
            is not needed and often can be worked around in a much more efficient
            way. Defaults to the value of ``create_graph``.
        create_graph (bool, optional): If ``True``, graph of the derivative will
            be constructed, allowing to compute higher order derivative products.
            Defaults to ``False``.
        inputs (sequence of Tensor): Inputs w.r.t. which the gradient will be
            accumulated into ``.grad``. All other Tensors will be ignored. If not
            provided, the gradient is accumulated into all the leaf Tensors that were
            used to compute the attr::tensors. All the provided inputs must be leaf
            Tensors.

# This function applies in case of gradient checkpointing for memory
# optimization. Currently, for gradient checkpointing, we only support imperative
# backwards call i.e. torch.autograd.backward() and the torch.autograd.grad() won't
# work. The reason being that: torch.autograd.grad() only calculates the grads
# for the inputs that are passed by user but it doesn't calculate grad for
# anything else e.g. model parameters like weights, bias etc. However, for
# torch.autograd.backward(), we would actually compute the grad for the weights as well.
#
# This function returns whether the checkpointing is valid i.e. torch.autograd.backward
# or not i.e. torch.autograd.grad. The implementation works by maintaining a thread
# local variable in torch/csrc/autograd/engine.cpp which looks at the NodeTask
# in the stack and before a NodeTask is executed in evaluate_function, it
# checks for whether reentrant backwards is imperative or not.
