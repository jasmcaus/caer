    See the Note on extending the autograd engine for more details on how to use
    this class: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/extending.html#extending-torch-autograd

    Every operation performed on :class:`Tensor` s creates a new function
    object, that performs the computation, and records that it happened.
    The history is retained in the form of a DAG of functions, with edges
    denoting data dependencies (``input <- output``). Then, when backward is
    called, the graph is processed in the topological ordering, by calling
    :func:`backward` methods of each :class:`Function` object, and passing
    returned gradients on to next :class:`Function` s.

    Normally, the only way users interact with functions is by creating
    subclasses and defining new operations. This is a recommended way of
    extending torch.autograd.
