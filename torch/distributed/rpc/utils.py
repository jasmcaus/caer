def _parse_remote_device(remote_device: str):
    r"""
    Parses the remote device.

    Arguments:
        remote_device (str): Device on the destination worker where weâ€˜d like to place this module.
            The format should be "<workername>/<device>", where the device field can be parsed as torch.device type.
            E.g., "trainer0/cpu", "trainer0", "ps0/cuda:0".
            In addition, the device field can be optional and the default value is "cpu".

    Returns:
        A workername and a device.
