    Similar to ``allreduce_hook``, this hook first gathers ``GradBucket`` tensors
    and its ``then`` callback aggregates the gathered gradient tensors and takes
    mean. Instead of ``allreduce`` this hook uses ``allgather``. Note that with
    W workers, both the computation and communication time scale as O(W) for
    allgather compared to O(logW) for allreduce. Therefore, this hook is expected
    to be much slower than ``allreduce_hook`` although both essentially do the
    same thing with the gradients.

        This is for test and experiments. User is suggested to use a faster
        alternative called ``allreduce_hook``  that uses ``allreduce`` protocol
        instead of ``allgather`` protocol.
