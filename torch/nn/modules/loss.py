class NLLLoss(_WeightedLoss):
    r"""The negative log likelihood loss. It is useful to train a classification
    problem with `C` classes.

    If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D Tensor assigning
    weight to each of the classes. This is particularly useful when you have an
    unbalanced training set.

    The `input` given through a forward call is expected to contain
    log-probabilities of each class. `input` has to be a Tensor of size either
    :math:`(minibatch, C)` or :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)`
    with :math:`K \geq 1` for the `K`-dimensional case (described later).

    Obtaining log-probabilities in a neural network is easily achieved by
    adding a  `LogSoftmax`  layer in the last layer of your network.
    You may use `CrossEntropyLoss` instead, if you prefer not to add an extra
    layer.

    The `target` that this loss expects should be a class index in the range :math:`[0, C-1]`
    where `C = number of classes`; if `ignore_index` is specified, this loss also accepts
    this class index (this index may not necessarily be in the class range).

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = - w_{y_n} x_{n,y_n}, \quad
        w_{c} = \text{weight}[c] \cdot \mathbb{1}\{c \not= \text{ignore\_index}\},

    where :math:`x` is the input, :math:`y` is the target, :math:`w` is the weight, and
    :math:`N` is the batch size. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{\sum_{n=1}^N w_{y_n}} l_n, &
            \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
            \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
            \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    Can also be used for higher dimension inputs, such as 2D images, by providing
    an input of size :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`,
    where :math:`K` is the number of dimensions, and a target of appropriate shape
    (see below). In the case of images, it computes NLL loss per-pixel.

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each
            class. If given, it has to be a Tensor of size `C`. Otherwise, it is
            treated as if having all ones.
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When
            :attr:`size_average` is ``True``, the loss is averaged over
            non-ignored targets.
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will
            be applied, ``'mean'``: the weighted mean of the output is taken,
            ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in
            the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override
            :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C)` where `C = number of classes`, or
          :math:`(N, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of `K`-dimensional loss.
        - Target: :math:`(N)` where each value is :math:`0 \leq \text{targets}[i] \leq C-1`, or

    r"""The Kullback-Leibler divergence loss measure

    `Kullback-Leibler divergence`_ is a useful distance measure for continuous
    distributions and is often useful when performing direct regression over
    the space of (discretely sampled) continuous output distributions.

    As with :class:`~torch.nn.NLLLoss`, the `input` given is expected to contain
    *log-probabilities* and is not restricted to a 2D Tensor.
    The targets are interpreted as *probabilities* by default, but could be considered
    as *log-probabilities* with :attr:`log_target` set to ``True``.

    This criterion expects a `target` `Tensor` of the same size as the
    `input` `Tensor`.

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        l(x,y) = L = \{ l_1,\dots,l_N \}, \quad
        l_n = y_n \cdot \left( \log y_n - x_n \right)

    where the index :math:`N` spans all dimensions of ``input`` and :math:`L` has the same
    shape as ``input``. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'`` (default ``'mean'``), then:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \operatorname{mean}(L), & \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';} \\
            \operatorname{sum}(L),  & \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    In default :attr:`reduction` mode ``'mean'``, the losses are averaged for each minibatch over observations
    **as well as** over dimensions. ``'batchmean'`` mode gives the correct KL divergence where losses
    are averaged over batch dimension only. ``'mean'`` mode's behavior will be changed to the same as
    ``'batchmean'`` in the next major release.

class BCELoss(_WeightedLoss):
    r"""Creates a criterion that measures the Binary Cross Entropy
    between the target and the output:

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = - w_n \left[ y_n \cdot \log x_n + (1 - y_n) \cdot \log (1 - x_n) \right],

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \operatorname{mean}(L), & \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
            \operatorname{sum}(L),  & \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    This is used for measuring the error of a reconstruction in for example
    an auto-encoder. Note that the targets :math:`y` should be numbers
    between 0 and 1.

    Notice that if :math:`x_n` is either 0 or 1, one of the log terms would be
    mathematically undefined in the above loss equation. PyTorch chooses to set
    :math:`\log (0) = -\infty`, since :math:`\lim_{x\to 0} \log (x) = -\infty`.
    However, an infinite term in the loss equation is not desirable for several reasons.

    For one, if either :math:`y_n = 0` or :math:`(1 - y_n) = 0`, then we would be
    multiplying 0 with infinity. Secondly, if we have an infinite loss value, then
    we would also have an infinite term in our gradient, since
    :math:`\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{d}{dx} \log (x) = \infty`.
    This would make BCELoss's backward method nonlinear with respect to :math:`x_n`,
    and using it for things like linear regression would not be straight-forward.

    Our solution is that BCELoss clamps its log function outputs to be greater than
    or equal to -100. This way, we can always have a finite loss value and a linear
    backward method.

class BCEWithLogitsLoss(_Loss):
    r"""This loss combines a `Sigmoid` layer and the `BCELoss` in one single
    class. This version is more numerically stable than using a plain `Sigmoid`
    followed by a `BCELoss` as, by combining the operations into one layer,
    we take advantage of the log-sum-exp trick for numerical stability.

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::

        \end{cases}

    This is used for measuring the error of a reconstruction in for example
    an auto-encoder. Note that the targets `t[i]` should be numbers
    between 0 and 1.

    It's possible to trade off recall and precision by adding weights to positive examples.
    In the case of multi-label classification the loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell_c(x, y) = L_c = \{l_{1,c},\dots,l_{N,c}\}^\top, \quad
        l_{n,c} = - w_{n,c} \left[ p_c y_{n,c} \cdot \log \sigma(x_{n,c})
        + (1 - y_{n,c}) \cdot \log (1 - \sigma(x_{n,c})) \right],

    where :math:`c` is the class number (:math:`c > 1` for multi-label binary classification,
    :math:`c = 1` for single-label binary classification),
    :math:`n` is the number of the sample in the batch and
    :math:`p_c` is the weight of the positive answer for the class :math:`c`.

    :math:`p_c > 1` increases the recall, :math:`p_c < 1` increases the precision.

    For example, if a dataset contains 100 positive and 300 negative examples of a single class,
    then `pos_weight` for the class should be equal to :math:`\frac{300}{100}=3`.
    The loss would act as if the dataset contains :math:`3\times 100=300` positive examples.

    Examples::

        >>> target = torch.ones([10, 64], dtype=torch.float32)  # 64 classes, batch size = 10

class CrossEntropyLoss(_WeightedLoss):
    r"""This criterion combines :class:`~torch.nn.LogSoftmax` and :class:`~torch.nn.NLLLoss` in one single class.

    It is useful when training a classification problem with `C` classes.
    If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D `Tensor`
    assigning weight to each of the classes.
    This is particularly useful when you have an unbalanced training set.

    The `input` is expected to contain raw, unnormalized scores for each class.

    `input` has to be a Tensor of size either :math:`(minibatch, C)` or
    :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)`
    with :math:`K \geq 1` for the `K`-dimensional case (described later).

    This criterion expects a class index in the range :math:`[0, C-1]` as the
    `target` for each value of a 1D tensor of size `minibatch`; if `ignore_index`
    is specified, this criterion also accepts this class index (this index may not
    necessarily be in the class range).

    The loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \text{loss}(x, class) = -\log\left(\frac{\exp(x[class])}{\sum_j \exp(x[j])}\right)
                       = -x[class] + \log\left(\sum_j \exp(x[j])\right)

    or in the case of the :attr:`weight` argument being specified:

    .. math::
        \text{loss}(x, class) = weight[class] \left(-x[class] + \log\left(\sum_j \exp(x[j])\right)\right)

    The losses are averaged across observations for each minibatch. If the
    :attr:`weight` argument is specified then this is a weighted average:

    .. math::
        \text{loss} = \frac{\sum^{N}_{i=1} loss(i, class[i])}{\sum^{N}_{i=1} weight[class[i]]}

    Can also be used for higher dimension inputs, such as 2D images, by providing
    an input of size :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`,
    where :math:`K` is the number of dimensions, and a target of appropriate shape
    (see below).


    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each class.
            If given, has to be a Tensor of size `C`
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When :attr:`size_average` is
            ``True``, the loss is averaged over non-ignored targets.
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will
            be applied, ``'mean'``: the weighted mean of the output is taken,
            ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in
            the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override
            :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, D)` where :math:`D` is the vector dimension.
        - Output: A Tensor of shape :math:`(N)` if :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, or a scalar
            otherwise.

class TripletMarginWithDistanceLoss(_Loss):
    r"""Creates a criterion that measures the triplet loss given input
    tensors :math:`a`, :math:`p`, and :math:`n` (representing anchor,
    positive, and negative examples, respectively), and a nonnegative,
    real-valued function ("distance function") used to compute the relationship
    between the anchor and positive example ("positive distance") and the
    anchor and negative example ("negative distance").

    The unreduced loss (i.e., with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``)
    can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(a, p, n) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_i = \max \{d(a_i, p_i) - d(a_i, n_i) + {\rm margin}, 0\}

    where :math:`N` is the batch size; :math:`d` is a nonnegative, real-valued function
    quantifying the closeness of two tensors, referred to as the :attr:`distance_function`;
    and :math:`margin` is a nonnegative margin representing the minimum difference
    between the positive and negative distances that is required for the loss to
    be 0.  The input tensors have :math:`N` elements each and can be of any shape
    that the distance function can handle.

    If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) =
        \begin{cases}
            \operatorname{mean}(L), &  \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
            \operatorname{sum}(L),  &  \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    See also :class:`~torch.nn.TripletMarginLoss`, which computes the triplet
    loss for input tensors using the :math:`l_p` distance as the distance function.

    Args:
        distance_function (callable, optional): A nonnegative, real-valued function that
            quantifies the closeness of two tensors. If not specified,
            `nn.PairwiseDistance` will be used.  Default: ``None``
        margin (float, optional): A nonnegative margin representing the minimum difference
            between the positive and negative distances required for the loss to be 0. Larger
            margins penalize cases where the negative examples are not distant enough from the
            anchors, relative to the positives. Default: :math:`1`.
        swap (bool, optional): Whether to use the distance swap described in the paper
            `Learning shallow convolutional feature descriptors with triplet losses` by
            V. Balntas, E. Riba et al. If True, and if the positive example is closer to the
            negative example than the anchor is, swaps the positive example and the anchor in
            the loss computation. Default: ``False``.
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the (optional) reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Default: ``'mean'``


    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, *)` where :math:`*` represents any number of additional dimensions
          as supported by the distance function.
        - Output: A Tensor of shape :math:`(N)` if :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, or a scalar
          otherwise.

class CTCLoss(_Loss):
    r"""The Connectionist Temporal Classification loss.

    Calculates loss between a continuous (unsegmented) time series and a target sequence. CTCLoss sums over the
    probability of possible alignments of input to target, producing a loss value which is differentiable
    with respect to each input node. The alignment of input to target is assumed to be "many-to-one", which
    limits the length of the target sequence such that it must be :math:`\leq` the input length.

    Args:
        blank (int, optional): blank label. Default :math:`0`.
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the output losses will be divided by the target lengths and
            then the mean over the batch is taken. Default: ``'mean'``
        zero_infinity (bool, optional):
            Whether to zero infinite losses and the associated gradients.
            Default: ``False``
            Infinite losses mainly occur when the inputs are too short
            to be aligned to the targets.

    Shape:
        - Log_probs: Tensor of size :math:`(T, N, C)`,
          where :math:`T = \text{input length}`,
          :math:`N = \text{batch size}`, and
          :math:`C = \text{number of classes (including blank)}`.
          The logarithmized probabilities of the outputs (e.g. obtained with
          :func:`torch.nn.functional.log_softmax`).
        - Targets: Tensor of size :math:`(N, S)` or
          :math:`(\operatorname{sum}(\text{target\_lengths}))`,
          where :math:`N = \text{batch size}` and
          :math:`S = \text{max target length, if shape is } (N, S)`.
          It represent the target sequences. Each element in the target
          sequence is a class index. And the target index cannot be blank (default=0).
          In the :math:`(N, S)` form, targets are padded to the
          length of the longest sequence, and stacked.
          In the :math:`(\operatorname{sum}(\text{target\_lengths}))` form,
          the targets are assumed to be un-padded and
          concatenated within 1 dimension.
        - Input_lengths: Tuple or tensor of size :math:`(N)`,
          where :math:`N = \text{batch size}`. It represent the lengths of the
          inputs (must each be :math:`\leq T`). And the lengths are specified
          for each sequence to achieve masking under the assumption that sequences
          are padded to equal lengths.
        - Target_lengths: Tuple or tensor of size :math:`(N)`,
          where :math:`N = \text{batch size}`. It represent lengths of the targets.
          Lengths are specified for each sequence to achieve masking under the
          assumption that sequences are padded to equal lengths. If target shape is
          :math:`(N,S)`, target_lengths are effectively the stop index
          :math:`s_n` for each target sequence, such that ``target_n = targets[n,0:s_n]`` for
          each target in a batch. Lengths must each be :math:`\leq S`
          If the targets are given as a 1d tensor that is the concatenation of individual
          targets, the target_lengths must add up to the total length of the tensor.
        - Output: scalar. If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then
          :math:`(N)`, where :math:`N = \text{batch size}`.

        https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/icml_2006.pdf

    Note:
        In order to use CuDNN, the following must be satisfied: :attr:`targets` must be
        in concatenated format, all :attr:`input_lengths` must be `T`.  :math:`blank=0`,
        :attr:`target_lengths` :math:`\leq 256`, the integer arguments must be of
        dtype :attr:`torch.int32`.

        The regular implementation uses the (more common in PyTorch) `torch.long` dtype.


    Note:
        In some circumstances when using the CUDA backend with CuDNN, this operator
        may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is
        undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic (potentially at
        a performance cost) by setting ``torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic =
        True``.
