    .. math::

    The mean and standard-deviation are calculated per-dimension over
    the mini-batches and :math:`\gamma` and :math:`\beta` are learnable parameter vectors
    of size `C` (where `C` is the input size). By default, the elements of :math:`\gamma` are set
    to 1 and the elements of :math:`\beta` are set to 0. The standard-deviation is calculated
    via the biased estimator, equivalent to `torch.var(input, unbiased=False)`.

    Also by default, during training this layer keeps running estimates of its
    computed mean and variance, which are then used for normalization during
    evaluation. The running estimates are kept with a default :attr:`momentum`
    of 0.1.

    If :attr:`track_running_stats` is set to ``False``, this layer then does not

    evaluation time as well.

        This :attr:`momentum` argument is different from one used in optimizer
        classes and the conventional notion of momentum. Mathematically, the
        update rule for running statistics here is
