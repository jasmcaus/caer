Contributing to Caer
==========================================

If you have improvements to `caer`, send us your pull requests! We'd love to accept your patches! For those just getting started, Github has a [how to](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). All bug fixes, new functionality, new tutorials etc. are (and should be) submitted via GitHub's mechanism of pull requests.

If you want to contribute, start working through the `caer` codebase, read the [Documentation](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/blob/master/DOCS.md), navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/issues) tab and start looking through interesting issues. 

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have been working on the PR can be accepted into the main repository.


Before you start contributing you should
----------------------------------------

-   Make sure you agree to the `caer` MIT license before you contribute your code

-   If you are submitting a new algorithm implementation, do a quick search over the internet to see whether the algorithm is patented or not. 

-   If you are going to fix a bug, check that it hasn't yet been spotted or there is someone working on it. In the latter, you might provide support or suggestion in the issue or in the linked pull request.

-   If you have a question about the software, then this is **NOT** the right place. Feel free to read the official [documentation](http://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/documentation.md) or if that does not help, you can contact one of the maintainers (use this as your last resort. Most of the time, we may not have the time to reply to your messages.)

Before you open up anything on the Caer GitHub page, be sure that you are at the right place with your problem.

Reporting issues
------------------------

You can report issues in the `caer` codebase by navigating to the [Issues](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/issues) tab. When reporting issues, please include as much detail as possible about your operating system, `caer` version and Python version. Whenever possible, include a brief, self-contained code example that demonstrates the problem.

A note on feature enhancements/API changes
------------------------

If you are interested in adding a new feature to Caer, consider submitting your feature proposal as a pull request using the label `suggest-feature` which is the preferred way for discussing new features and changes to the API.


Last, but certainly not the least! **Make sure you get due credit**. We try to highlight all the contributions and list major ones in the [Contributors List](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS) and release announcements, but sometimes we may inadvertently forget to do that. Please do not hesitate to remind us, and we will update it accordingly.

Happy Contributing!
